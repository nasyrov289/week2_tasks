# Week 2 Tasks
## About task
The first task was to create jar files from Java files.\
The second task was:
```
Create a diagram of these objects, what properties they have and how they interact with each other. 
Create POJO classes based on your diagram.
Push an image of the diagram to your remote repository.

Download MySQL and set up a local database on your computer. Create tables, one for each of your POJO classes.
Save the commands you use to create tables into a file titled "create.sql" and push it to your remote repository.
```
In the process of creating an online store project, there were difficulties with creating POJO classes, a database based on them. With the help of Saint Google and my comrades, I was able to understand how to solve with these problems, and made diagrams and created a local database using POJO classes.
